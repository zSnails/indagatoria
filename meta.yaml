abstract: |
  Kubernetes has emerged as the leading platform for container orchestration,
  enabling organizations to efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized
  applications across diverse environments. This paper explores the
  architecture of Kubernetes, detailing its control plane and worker nodes,
  which form the backbone of its modular and scalable design. It also examines
  various use cases, including large-scale web applications, data science
  pipelines, and edge computing, highlighting Kubernetes' flexibility and
  adaptability. Furthermore, the paper discusses the current state of
  Kubernetes, focusing on advancements such as serverless computing,
  multi-cluster management, and its growing application in AI/ML and edge
  environments. Comparisons with other orchestration tools like Docker Swarm
  and Apache Mesos illustrate Kubernetes' strengths and areas of
  specialization. Finally, real-world case studies demonstrate its impact on
  companies like Airbnb, Spotify, and CERN, showcasing how Kubernetes optimizes
  scalability, operational efficiency, and performance in high-demand
  scenarios.
