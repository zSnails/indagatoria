# Introduction

Kubernetes, an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and
management of containerized applications, has become a cornerstone of modern
cloud-native infrastructure. Born from Google's internal systems, Kubernetes enables
developers to manage containerized applications across various environments, from
on-premises data centers to public clouds. This flexibility has made Kubernetes a
popular choice for organizations seeking to streamline their DevOps processes,
ensuring consistent and reliable application performance across diverse
infrastructure setups. The growing adoption of Kubernetes reflects the broader trend
towards containerization, which offers significant advantages in terms of resource
efficiency, scalability, and portability in application deployment.
