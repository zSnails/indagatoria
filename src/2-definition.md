## Definition

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Kubernetes manages these containers across a cluster of machines, ensuring that the desired state of the application is maintained. This involves orchestrating the lifecycle of containers, automating the placement and scheduling of containers, and managing their interaction with each other. By doing so, Kubernetes abstracts away the complexity of container management, allowing developers to focus on building and deploying applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure [@Julien_2024].
