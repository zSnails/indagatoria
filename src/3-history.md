# History

The history of Kubernetes is deeply rooted in Google's experience with large-scale
container management. The journey began with "Borg," an internal cluster management
system developed by Google in the early 2000s to handle its growing infrastructure
needs. Borg's success laid the groundwork for Kubernetes, incorporating lessons
learned from managing containers at scale. In 2013, as Docker popularized the concept
of containers, Google recognized the need for an open-source container orchestration
platform that could be used by the broader developer community. This led to the
development of Kubernetes, which was publicly released in 2014 under the stewardship
of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Since then, Kubernetes has evolved
rapidly, becoming the de facto standard for container orchestration in the industry
[@IBM_2024].
