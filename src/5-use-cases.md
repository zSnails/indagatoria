# Use Cases

## Large-Scale Web Applications

Kubernetes is ideal for deploying, scaling, and maintaining large-scale applications
like e-commerce platforms, SaaS applications, or social media services, where uptime
and resilience are critical.

## Data Science and Machine Learning Pipelines

It’s increasingly used for managing data processing and machine learning workflows.
For example, Kubernetes can coordinate large-scale parallel computations using
frameworks like Apache Spark, or manage ML models in production, facilitating dynamic
scaling and retraining [@kubeflowML2023].

## Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments

Organizations often use Kubernetes to build hybrid cloud systems where applications
span on-premise data centers and public cloud providers. Kubernetes abstracts the
underlying infrastructure, allowing for consistent application behavior across
different environments [@bijit2023multicloud].

## DevOps Automation

Kubernetes is central to CI/CD pipelines, ensuring automated build, test, and
deployment workflows. It allows for rolling updates, A/B testing, and quick rollbacks
in case of issues, making it easier to manage production environments with minimal
downtime [@burns2019kubernetes].

## Edge Computing and IoT

Lightweight Kubernetes distributions (like K3s) are being used at the edge, where
devices or microservices are deployed in resource-constrained environments, such as
in remote locations or IoT networks. Kubernetes’ orchestration capabilities provide a
consistent way to manage these deployments remotely [@kivimaki2021evaluation].
